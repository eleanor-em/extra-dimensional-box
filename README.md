# Extra-Dimensional Box
This began as a university project (Distributed Systems project 2: team nutella).
I've gone above and beyond the requirements, focusing on stability and massive parallelisation.

The repository contains some code by Benjamin (Jingyi) Li, Andrea Law, Aaron Harwood, and Andrew Wang.

To facilitate running several peers at once in IntelliJ, there are folders named `config1`, `config2`, etc. Each of these are the working directory for a different run configuration, so that the `configuration.properties` file can be set differently for each instance of the program. There are also different `share` folders, one within each of the `config` folders, so that the distributed file system can be tested properly.
